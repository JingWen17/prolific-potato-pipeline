# prolific-potato-pipeline
A practical guide for running user studies with Prolific and Potato. Includes my workflow and an open space for discussion, feedback, and shared problem-solving.

This repository documents the workflow I used to run survey-based user experiments using Prolific and Potato. It’s meant to serve as an open platform for anyone interested in setting up similar studies to explore, share insights, and discuss challenges. The process described here is based on my own experience and may not fit every use case, but I’m happy to talk about potential issues, alternative solutions, and improvements:).
