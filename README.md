# prolific-potato-pipeline

A public repository documenting my detailed experience running online user research using Prolific and Potato. It’s meant to serve as an open platform for anyone interested in setting up similar studies to explore, share insights, and discuss challenges. The process described here is based on my own experience and may not fit every use case, but I’m happy to talk about potential issues, alternative solutions, and improvements:).

In this repository, I'll use our study as an example case to show the details in the pipeline. The study was part of our paper "*Understanding the Impact of Algorithmic Accuracy and Transparency on User Perceptions in Keyword-Driven Contextual Advertising*", where we use online surveys to collect users perception on ad-article combinations.
